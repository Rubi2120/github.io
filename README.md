 Hi there 👋

I’m Rubi, your friendly bio explorer 🧬

Reach me at: rubimarch201@gmail.com

I’m an undergraduate genomics student at UNAM, Juriquilla, Querétaro. 

I’m passionate about liver disease and cancer, especially how the metabolic environment  affects disease progression.

I’m interested in spatial transcriptomics and multi-omics data integration. I love exploring how genetic population-specific variation impacts disease risk, particularly in underrepresented populations. 

I’m always eager to learn new computational and experimental approaches to connect with disease biology.
Outside of research, I enjoy:
* 🎸 Playing guitar
* 📚 Reading
* 🎶 Learning about music (especially rock)
* 🏃 Running
* 🌳 Spending time outside
* 😴 Sleeping
* 🎬 Watching movies

I love cats 🐱 and orcas 🐋.
