#### **Bio** 
Hi there 👋

I’m Rubi, your friendly bio explorer 🧬

📧 Reach me at: rubimarch201@gmail.com

I’m passionate about liver disease and cancer, especially how the metabolic environment affects disease progression.

I’m interested in spatial transcriptomics and multi-omics data integration. 

I love exploring how genetic population-specific variation impacts disease risk, particularly in underrepresented populations.

I’m always eager to learn new computational and experimental approaches to connect with disease biology.

#### **Hobbies & Interests**

Outside of research, I enjoy:

- 🎸 Playing guitar
- 📚 Reading
- 🎶 Learning about music (especially rock)
- 🏃 Running
- 🌳 Spending time outside
- 😴 Sleeping
- 🎬 Watching movies
